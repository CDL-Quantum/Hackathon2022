# Business Application

Machine learning is ubiquitous in many of the best solutions to industrial problems. Quantum computing is proposed to enhance machine learning. We have used the case of fraud detection as a demonstration to show that using LDA as a preprocessing method with a variational classifier could enhance the QML model's performance and allow it to process a lot more features. And we believe that this could be further improved in the future. 

Since this is an improvement based on existing machine learning models, it has direct application in real cases. In principle, this could eventually be generalized for any multi-class classification problem. 

We are seeing that the finance sector is always within the top 3 industries related to quantum computing use cases and benefits. Example problems that our approach could be applied to include: 

- Credit scoring
- Fraud detection
- Default forecasting
- Churn prediction
- Loan approval

and many more. 

In other industries, improvement of classification also has many benefits. A quick but not complete list would include:

- Energy: energy loss detection.
- E-commerce: recommendation system.
- Several industries: forecasting.
- Healthcare: diagnosis.

    "The problem of trash in space has become a boiling issue: objects are orbiting around the earth, endangering the space expeditions. They are composed of dysfunctional instruments that are no longer in use, or broken parts that were torn apart from a larger device. In spite of being mostly very small, they travel at such impressive speeds that by Newton's law, any shock with one of these could cause tremendous damage to a space ship or a satellite. Since these space expeditions are very costly, it is a major challenge to avoid them, and to remove them from space in the long term. Therefore, the challenge of cleaning space has been undertaken by companies, space agencies and public institutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To optimize their travel and collection schedule, two main constraints should be fulfilled:\n",
    "1) Since the space ship has limited capacity, it can only collect so much that it can contain.\n",
    "2) Fuel can also be contained in limited amounts, and is in itself very expensive. It is hence desirable to travel the longest distance that the fuel quantity allows.\n",
    "\n",
    "To formulate it simply, the challenge is to find the shortest path between debris that gathers the most of them, within the capactity of the ship. Using brute force, one would have to try all possible combinations of debris to find the one that fulfills these conditions the best. It is therefore a combinatorial optimization problem that would grow exponentially in the number of debris to choose from. It is therefore unscalable and untractable to classical computer at large scales. To circumvent this delicate issue, we propose to use a quantum-classical algorithm to get a better solution than a classical computer could get. Using the gate-based model in quantum computing, we solve the problem with the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm.\n",

    "## Cost function \n",
    "\n",
    "To perform the optimization, we first express the problem in a cost function that we attempt to minimize. We start with a set of N debris. We encode the information about the debris in a bitstring:\\begin{equation}\n",
    "z = z_1 z_2 \\cdots z_N, \\text{where } z_i = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "1, & \\text{if debris i is collected} \\\\\n",
    "0, & \\text{if otherwise.}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the problem with brute force method, we must inspect all possible bitstrings $z$ and pick the one that maximizes the volume of the debris collected. Therefore, it is a combinatorial optimization problem. To formulate it, we pair each debris $i$ with its weight/size $w_i$. The debris locations can be reported on a graph with edge set $E$ and vertex set $V$ such that $G = \\{E,V\\}$. Each vertex is associated with a weight, and each edge $i -j$ with a distance $d_{ij}$. With these notations, we encode the problem into the cost function:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "C(z) = (V-\\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i z_i)^2 + \\sum_{i<j}^{N} d_{ij} z_i z_j\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where the first term corresponds to the knapsack problem and the second aims at minimizing the travelled distance. To simplify the implementation, the constant term can be removed:\n",

    "C(z) &=  (-2V\\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i z_i + 2\\sum_{i<j}^N w_i w_j z_i z_j) + \\sum_{i<j}^{N} d_{ij} z_i z_j \\\\\n",

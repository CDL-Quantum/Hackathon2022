# Business Application of Quantum Algorithm for the Sensitivity Analysis of Business Risks


# Quantum algorithm

- Problem definition

- Compilation (Processor design / gate implementation)

- Performance analysis: 
- Following the methology by Deutsche Borse Group we present a quantum algorithm (namely Grover's algorithm) to address the sensitivity analysis for a risk model..., which found to be computationally too expensive to perform by classical algorithms.

$H = - \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle, \sigma} t_{xy}^{ij}(\hat{c]_{i \sigma}^{\dagger} \hat{c}_{j \sigma} + h.c.) +...$

i and j denote the sites which are adjacent to each other.

total density operator $\hat{n}_i = ...$


# Real-world problems

- Correlation clustering problem (undirected graph): Multiple-person pose estimation [Pishchulin et al., 2016]


Solid material structures such as graphene, ferromagnetic lattices, Silicium square and cubic lattices.

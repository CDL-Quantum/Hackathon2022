# Business Application of Quantum Algorithm for the Sensitivity Analysis of Business Risks


# Technical problem

- Graphs

Full stack approach:

- Problem definition

- Quantum algorithm

- Compilation (Processor design / gate implementation)

- Performance analysis

- Hubbard model:

$H = - \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle, \sigma} t_{xy}^{ij}(\hat{c]_{i \sigma}^{\dagger} \hat{c}_{j \sigma} + h.c.) +...$

i and j denote the sites which are adjacent to each other.

total density operator $\hat{n}_i = ...$

Tight binding model


# Real-world problems

- Correlation clustering problem (undirected graph): Multiple-person pose estimation [Pishchulin et al., 2016]



Solid material structures such as graphene, ferromagnetic lattices, Silicium square and cubic lattices.

# Potential customers

Potential customers of a simulation tool to predict the band structures of solid materials are photovoltaics companies..

Solid material structures such as graphene, ferromagnetic lattices, Silicium square and cubic lattices can also be simulated with the Hubbard model. Such materials can be found in a wide range of applications such as aviation composites, semi-conductors and specialized coatings.

# Business Application of Quantum Algorithm for the Sensitivity Analysis of Business Risks


# Quantum algorithm

- Problem definition: 
Quantum algorithms are known for super-polynomial speedup over their classical counterparts.
They can be applied to various real-world problems such as cryptography, optimisation, and simulations. 

- Compilation (Processor design / gate implementation)

- Performance analysis: 
 Following the methology by Deutsche BÃ¶rse Group we present a quantum algorithm (namely Grover's algorithm) to address the sensitivity analysis for a risk model..., which found to be computationally too expensive to perform by classical algorithms. 
Grover's algorithm (1996) is known for its ability to address unstructured search problems, which are basic problems in computer science.
Here, we implement and analysis the risk modeling and its representation on quantum circuits using this algorithm. 
The fact that quantum algorithms are faster than a classical ones can be tested by the code execution runtime, measured by the number of elementary operations used by an algorithm, and can be done using the quantum circuit model.

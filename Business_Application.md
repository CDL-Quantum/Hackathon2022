# Business Application of Quantum Algorithm for the Sensitivity Analysis of Business Risks


# Quantum algorithm

- Problem definition: 
Quantum algorithms are known for super-polynomial speedup over their classical counterparts.
They can be applied to various real-world problems such as cryptography, optimisation, and simulations. 

- Compilation (Processor design / gate implementation)

- Performance analysis: 
 Following the methology by Deutsche Borse Group we present a quantum algorithm (namely Grover's algorithm) to address the sensitivity analysis for a risk model..., which found to be computationally too expensive to perform by classical algorithms. We implement and analysis the risk modeling and its representation on quantum circuits. 
The fact that quantum algorithms are faster than a classical ones can be tested by the code execution runtime, which is measured by the number of elementary operations used by an algorithm. This can be done using the quantum circuit model. 

$H = - \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle, \sigma} t_{xy}^{ij}(\hat{c]_{i \sigma}^{\dagger} \hat{c}_{j \sigma} + h.c.) +...$

i and j denote the sites which are adjacent to each other.
